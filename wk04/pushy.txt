Tests:
- don't test whether .pushy folder matches (matching this folder isn't required behaviour)

Things you might like to test:
- output
- exit/return values
- file system structure (particularly with rm, checkout and merge)

Ways to more quickly test correct output and values:
- scripts to compare same commands on both yours and reference
